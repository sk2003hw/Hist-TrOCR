# Hist-TrOCR  
Fine-tuned TrOCR on Historical Text (from [the ARDIS Dataset](https://ardisdataset.github.io/ARDIS/)- Part I and [the Washington Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/washington-database)- line images).  

The Jupyter notebook can be downloaded and run using any compatible IDE or viewed from [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11vWXRLM4gz9h5hFpPRR_DEgd7U-t9ZVp?usp=sharing). The data has to be downloaded from the previously attached links or from [here for the ARDIS Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EN0hbqE1EjXCp6jZVqB-7DdWPTvDk63a?usp=sharing), [here for the Wasington Database](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I2s3rrfOKncPAamB6PCL7cSwe1ykHk_d?usp=sharing) and [here for the IAM Handwriting Database](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n7ePKEf4v1Z_B_w99dQnl6ij7giEPjnf?usp=sharing) (used in the experiments). To run the Colab notebook, the datasets have to be saved in Google Drive and the path of the datasets have to be updated in the code depending on the location of the data in your Google Drive.
